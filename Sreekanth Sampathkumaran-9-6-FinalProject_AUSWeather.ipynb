This is useful in situations where perfectly collinear<br>features cause problems, such as when feeding the resulting data<br>into an unregularized linear regression model.<br><br>However, dropping one category breaks the symmetry of the original<br>representation and can therefore induce a bias in downstream models,<br>for instance for penalized linear classification or regression models.<br><br>- None : retain all features (the default).<br>- 'first' : drop the first category in each feature. If only one<br>  category is present, the feature will be dropped entirely.<br>- 'if_binary' : drop the first category in each feature with two<br>  categories. Features with 1 or more than 2 categories are<br>  left intact.<br>- array : ``drop[i]`` is the category in feature ``X[:, i]`` that<br>  should be dropped.<br><br>When `max_categories` or `min_frequency` is configured to group<br>infrequent categories, the dropping behavior is handled after the<br>grouping.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.21<br>   The parameter `drop` was added in 0.21.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 0.23<br>   The option `drop='if_binary'` was added in 0.23.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 1.1<br>    Support for dropping infrequent categories.</span>\n",
